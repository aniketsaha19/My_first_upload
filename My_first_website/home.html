				<h2>
					ROME
				</h2>
				<p class="paramargin">
					With its thousand-year-old buildings, beautiful piazzas and world-class art – not to mention Vatican City – we’re certainly 
					not surprised. Rome, after all, is the capital of the so-called bel paese, or “beautiful country”.

				<h2>
					FLORENCE
				</h2>
				<p class="paramargin">
					The cathedral dome that dominates the city’s skyline is just one of the many attractions that make Florence one of the most 
					beautiful cities in the world. The river Arno that cuts through the heart of the city, the Piazza della Signoria 
					and the gorgeous church of San Miniato al Monte are all among Florence’s highlights.

				<h2>
					PARIS
				</h2>
				<p class="paramargin">
					 France’s capital has been long considered the paragon of style and the most glamorous city in Europe – and we can’t disagree 
					 with your choice to put Paris near the top of this poll. We love its elegant streets and boulevards, the lofty Eiffel Tower 
					 and the huge range of incredible art and architecture found throughout the city.

				<h2>
					EDINBURGH
				</h2>
				<p class="paramargin">
					It’s famed for its excellent annual festival, but there is more to Edinburgh than great comedy and arts – and according to you, it’s beauty. 
					Head east of the city and make the short walk up Arthur’s Seat, an 823ft-high dormant volcano, to take in views of Scotland’s capital 
					and you won’t need to question why it’s been voted the 4th most beautiful city in the world.

				<h2>
					LONDON
				</h2>
				<p class="paramargin">
					With sprawling green spaces, its huge gothic parliament buildings and perhaps the most famous residence in the world, 
					Buckingham Palace, London can lay claim to being one of the most beautiful cities ever built. Even in the grittier east
					you can find allure at Columbia Road flower market, or atop the hill in Greenwich Park overlooking the Canary Wharf towers 
					across the Thames.
